1        R"Yes, the sky is usually blue. This is because sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][3]. However, the sky isn't always blue. When the sun is low in the sky, at sunrise or sunset, it can take on a red hue[^2^][2]. This is explained by the same physics — Rayleigh scattering — as the blueness of the sky at other times[^2^][2]."

5        R"Yes, humans breathe oxygen. Oxygen is vital for cellular respiration, which extracts energy from the reaction of oxygen with molecules derived from food and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product[^1^][2]. The human body takes the oxygen breathed in from the lungs and transports it to the other parts of the body via the body's red blood cells[^2^][4]. Each cell uses and requires oxygen to thrive[^2^][4].

They find mates, give birth to their young, and find food in water[^4^][4]. Different biotic and abiotic factors influence where fish live including the water temperature, pH levels, dissolved oxygen levels, plankton, and other chemical components of the water[^1^][1]. Fish habitats are important because they provide a place for fish to live, breed, and raise their young[^1^][1]. There are many different types of fish habitats, including lakes, rivers, oceans, and ponds[^1^][1]. Some fish prefer calm waters while others prefer fast-moving streams or turbulent seas[^1^][1].

They collect nectar from flowers and convert it into honey inside their hives[^1^][1][^2^][2]. The nectar is stored in a second stomach, also known as the “honey stomach.” After they have filled up their second stomach, the bees will return to their hive and start to pass the nectar through their mouths to other bees[^2^][2]. These bees will chew on the nectar for about 30 minutes, turning it into honey[^2^][2]. Once the nectar becomes honey, the honeybees will store it in honeycomb cells, which act as little jars made of wax[^2^][2]. The bees then flap their wings over the honey to make it thicker and more like syrup instead of sweet juice[^2^][2]. Once the honey is ready, the bees will seal the cell using a wax lid to store it for later[^2^][2]. At this point, skilled beekeepers can take some of the finished honey from the hive, taking care to not harm or damage the colony[^2^][2]."

27        R"Yes, trees do have leaves[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][3][^4^][4]. Leaves are very important for trees as they provide food for the whole tree[^4^][4]. They capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development[^1^][1]. Trees have evolved leaves in a wide range of shapes and sizes, in response to environmental pressures including climate and predation[^1^][1]. They can be broad or needle-like, simple or compound, lobed or entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or evergreen[^1^][1]."

However, it is not uncommon to find a spider that has less than 8 legs due to other reasons in nature[^3^][3]. The cause for this is that some spiders may lose a leg or two for unnatural reasons[^3^][3]. Spiders, unlike insects, have only two main body parts (tagmata) instead of three: a fused head and thorax (called a cephalothorax or prosoma) and an abdomen (also called an opisthosoma)[^2^][2]. Spiders' legs are made up of seven segments[^2^][2]. Starting from the body end, these are the coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus and tarsus[^2^][2].

43        R"Yes, the Statue of Liberty is green[^1^][3][^2^][4][^3^][5]. However, it wasn't always green. When the Statue was unveiled in 1886, it was a shiny brown color, like a penny[^1^][3]. By 1906, the color had changed to green[^1^][3]. The reason the Statue of Liberty changed colors is that the outer surface is covered with hundreds of thin copper sheets[^1^][3]. Copper reacts with the air to form a patina or verdigris[^1^][3]. The verdigris layer protects the underlying metal from corrosion and degradation, which is why copper, brass, and bronze sculptures are so durable[^1^][3]. Chemical Reactions That Make the Statue of Liberty Green Most people know copper reacts with air to form verdigris, but the Statue of Liberty is its own special color because of its unique environmental conditions[^1^][3]. It's not a simple single reaction between copper and oxygen to produce a green oxide as you might think[^1^][3]. The copper oxide continues to react to make copper carbonates, copper sulfide, and copper sulfate[^1^][3]. There are three main compounds that form the blue-green patina: Cu 4 SO 4 (OH) 6 (green) Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) 2 (green) Cu 3 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 2 (blue)[^1^][3]. Here's what happens: Initially, copper reacts with oxygen from the air in an oxidation-reduction or redox reaction[^1^][3]. Copper donates electrons to oxygen, which oxidizes the copper and reduces the oxygen[^1^][3]. Then the copper (I) oxide continues to react with oxygen to form copper oxide (CuO)[^1^][3]. At the time the Statue of Liberty was built, the air contained a lot of sulfur from air pollution produced by burning coal[^1^][3]. The CuS reacts with carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the air and hydroxide ions (OH -) from water vapor to form three compounds[^1^][3]. The speed at which the patina develops (20 years, in the case of the Statue of Liberty) and color depends on the humidity and air pollution, not just the presence of oxygen and carbon dioxide[^1^][3]. Patina develops and evolves over time[^1^][3]. Nearly all the copper in the Statue is still the original metal, so the verdigris has been developing for over 130 years[^1^][3]."

44        R"Yes, rainbows are formed by the refraction and reflection of light[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][3]. When light from the sun is scattered by water droplets (e.g. raindrops or fog), it undergoes a process called refraction[^2^][2]. Refraction occurs when the light changes direction when passing through a medium denser than air, such as a raindrop[^2^][2]. Once the refracted light enters the raindrop, it is reflected off the back and then refracted again as it exits and travels to our eyes[^2^][2]. The different colors of a rainbow result from light being refracted, or bent, when entering a water droplet, then being reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it[^1^][1]. In all these events, the light is separated into various colors as each color is bent by a different amount[^1^][1]."

It is the focus of the vast metropolitan area often called Greater Tokyo, the largest urban and industrial agglomeration in Japan[^2^][2]. The city was renamed Tokyo, meaning “eastern capital”, in 1868[^2^][2]. Despite many changes happening over the years, both constructionally and politically, the main reason Tokyo was declared Japan’s Capital was because The Emperor moved there[^1^][1]. When the Tokugawa Shogunate government ended in 1868, after almost 260 years, imperial rule was restored[^1^][1]. In the process, The Emperor moved to Edo and renamed it Tokyo[^1^][1]. It was then officially named Japan’s Capital in 1868, interestingly enough, 21 years before it was officially made a city[^1^][1]."

51        R"Yes, owls do hunt at night[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][3][^4^][4][^5^][5]. They are nocturnal animals, meaning they are active at night[^1^][1][^4^][4]. Their eyes have evolved to be better able to see in low light, and their hearing is also improved at night[^1^][1]. Also, owls hunt by sight to track their prey; therefore, hunting at night is the best time to capture their prey[^4^][4]. Their dark colors make them nearly invisible to their prey and their wings beat almost silently[^3^][3]. These adaptations, combined with their enormous eyes, put owls among the most efficient night hunters on the planet[^3^][3]. However, it's important to note that some owl species hunt during the day or in open areas[^1^][1]."

The yen, denoted by the symbol ¥ and the code JPY, is the official currency of Japan[^1^][2][^2^][3][^3^][4][^4^][5]. It is the third-most traded currency in the foreign exchange market, after the United States dollar (US$) and the euro[^1^][2]. It is also widely used as a third reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro[^1^][2]. The yen was introduced in 1871 and is available in 10 denominations[^2^][3]. Six coins are used including 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 yen values, alongside 4 bills/notes including 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 and 10,000 (although the 2,000 yen note is quite rare)[^2^][3]."

53        R"Yes, tomatoes are technically considered fruits[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][4]. This is because, botanically, a fruit is a ripened flower ovary and contains seeds[^2^][2][^3^][4]. Tomatoes form from flowers and contain seeds, which makes them a fruit in botanical terms[^2^][2]. However, in culinary uses and even in legal terms, tomatoes are often referred to as vegetables[^1^][1][^2^][2][^4^][5]. This is due to their savory flavor profile and their usage in cooking, which is more similar to vegetables than fruits[^2^][2]. So, while tomatoes are botanically fruits, they are culinarily and legally treated as vegetables[^1^][1][^2^][2][^4^][5]."

54        R"Yes, the Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean on Earth[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][3][^4^][4]. It covers an area of approximately 106,460,000 square kilometers (41,105,000 square miles)[^1^][1]. The Atlantic Ocean is only slightly larger than half the size of the Pacific Ocean, which is the largest ocean[^1^][1][^2^][2]. The Atlantic Ocean lies between North and South America on the west and Europe and Africa on the east[^1^][1][^2^][2]. It's interesting to note that scientists often divide the Atlantic into two basins: the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic[^1^][1]. The North Atlantic, where waters sink after being chilled by arctic temperatures, is the start of the “global ocean conveyor,” a circulation pattern that helps regulate Earth’s climate[^1^][1]."

55        R"Yes, kangaroos do hop[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][3][^4^][4][^5^][5]. They are the only large mammals to use hopping on two legs as their main form of locomotion[^1^][1][^3^][3]. This movement has evolved to be energy efficient and help them survive in the wild[^4^][4]. The kangaroo's leg bone aligns with an oversized fourth toe on each foot, allowing it to propel the foot off the ground[^1^][1]. A single hop can propel a kangaroo 25 feet (7.6 meters) forward and 6 feet (1.8 meters) high[^1^][1]. However, it's important to note that not all kangaroos hop in the same way. Some smaller species and tree-dwelling kangaroos move in a different manner[^2^][2]."

58        R"Yes, light bulbs do produce light[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][3][^4^][4][^5^][5]. The process involves an electric current passing through a thin wire filament inside the bulb, causing it to heat up and emit visible light[^2^][2][^4^][4]. The filament is usually made of a hard-to-melt metal like tungsten and is encased in a glass bulb filled with inert gases to prevent oxidation and disintegration[^1^][1][^3^][3][^5^][5]. The agitation and vibration of the atoms within the filament material produce heat energy, and a portion of that energy is turned into light[^1^][1][^3^][3][^5^][5]. However, most of the energy gets turned into heat, which is why alternatives like LED lights are being developed[^1^][1]."

The planets all formed from a spinning disk-shaped cloud, and continued this rotating course around the Sun after they were formed[^3^][3]. The gravity of the Sun keeps the planets in their orbits[^3^][3]. They stay in their orbits because there is no other force in the Solar System which can stop them[^3^][3]. An orbit is caused by the gravitational pull of an object. A big object, like the Sun or other stars, have a stronger gravitational pull. Since there are smaller objects (planets) around the Sun, they start to spin around the Sun or orbit[^2^][2].

Likely completed in 1506, the piece features a portrait of a seated woman set against an imaginary landscape[^2^][3]. The sitter’s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo’s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin[^1^][1]. The Mona Lisa is likely a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo[^1^][1][^3^][4].

98        R"Yes, spiders do spin webs[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][3][^4^][4]. Spiders are skillful engineers, gifted with amazing planning skills and a material that allows them to precisely design rigorous and functional webs[^1^][1]. The material—spider silk—has chemical properties that make it lustrous, strong, and light[^1^][1]. Any individual spider can make up to seven different types of silk, but most generally make four to five kinds[^1^][1]. Spiders use their silk for several purposes, including web-building[^1^][1]. That diversity is not hard to imagine, given that Earth hosts 45,749 species of spiders[^1^][1]. The architecture of a web is very species-specific[^1^][1][^4^][4]. Some spiders even eat their own webs when they are done with them, as a way to replenish the silk supply[^1^][1]. Spider silk is made of connected protein chains that help make it strong, along with unconnected areas that give it flexibility[^1^][1]. It is produced in internal glands, moving from a soluble form to a hardened form and then spun into fiber by the spinnerets on the spider’s abdomen[^1^][1]. Spiders’ multiple spinnerets and eight legs come in handy for web-building[^1^][1][^4^][4]. The typical orb weaver spider will build a planar orb web, suspended by seven guy lines attached to leaves, twigs, rocks, telephone poles, or other surfaces[^1^][1]. Then the spider starts to spin its web, a relatively simple and predictable process[^1^][1]. It begins at the outside and works its way in, attaching segment by segment with its legs, creating concentric circles and ending with a center spiral of sticky silk that traps much-needed prey[^1^][1]."

The Greeks themselves imagined Homer was from Chios or Ionia and credited him with both the Iliad and Odyssey, the two masterpieces of Greek literature². Homer's authorship was infrequently questioned in antiquity, but contemporary scholarship predominantly assumes that the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed independently and that the stories formed as part of a long oral tradition¹."
